# RabbitMQ Implementation Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the RabbitMQ implementation in the ConnectFlow project.

## 1. Monitoring Enhancements

### 1.1 RabbitMQ Exporter Integration

- Added the RabbitMQ Prometheus Exporter to export RabbitMQ metrics
- Configured Prometheus to scrape these metrics
- Created a comprehensive RabbitMQ dashboard in Grafana

### 1.2 Application-Level Metrics

- Implemented RabbitMQMetrics class to track:
  - Published messages
  - Consumed messages
  - Failed messages
  - Retry attempts
  - Dead-lettered messages
- Integrated metrics collection in publishers and consumers
- Connected metrics to OpenTelemetry for better observability

## 2. Documentation

- Created comprehensive RABBITMQ.md documentation explaining:
  - Overall architecture
  - Configuration options
  - Monitoring setup
  - Step-by-step guides for creating new queues and consumers
  - Error handling and retry strategies
  - Best practices

## 3. Resilience Improvements

- Enhanced health checks for RabbitMQ connections
- Added better error logging with contextual information
- Improved metrics for monitoring queue depths and message rates

## 4. Deployment Enhancements

- Updated docker-compose.yml with RabbitMQ exporter configuration
- Configured Prometheus to scrape RabbitMQ metrics
- Added Grafana dashboard for RabbitMQ monitoring

## 5. Using the New Features

### 5.1 Viewing RabbitMQ Metrics

1. Start the Docker environment with `docker-compose up -d`
2. Access the Grafana dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Navigate to the RabbitMQ Dashboard
4. Monitor queues, connections, and message rates

### 5.2 Health Monitoring

- RabbitMQ health is now included in the application health checks
- View health status at [http://localhost:5010/health](http://localhost:5010/health) (adjust port as needed)
- Health check UI available at [http://localhost:5010/healthz](http://localhost:5010/healthz)

### 5.3 Creating New Message Flows

- Follow the documentation in RABBITMQ.md for creating new queues and consumers
- Use the RabbitMQMetrics service to track message flow performance
- Monitor new queues in the Grafana dashboard automatically
