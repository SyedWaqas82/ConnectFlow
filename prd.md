ConnectFlow Pro - Product Requirements Document
Product Overview
Product Name: ConnectFlow Pro
Tagline: "The Only Social CRM Built for Service Businesses"
Executive Summary
ConnectFlow Pro is the first social CRM platform specifically designed for service-based businesses that require appointment scheduling alongside customer relationship management. Unlike messaging-focused competitors (Callbell, WATI, Interakt), ConnectFlow Pro bridges the gap between social engagement and revenue generation through integrated appointment booking, multi-model AI customer service, and comprehensive business analytics.
While existing solutions treat social messaging as an isolated function, ConnectFlow Pro creates a complete customer journey from first social interaction through service delivery and retention. This makes it the go-to platform for healthcare providers, beauty salons, fitness centers, consultants, and any business where appointments drive revenue.
Product Vision
To become the definitive platform for service businesses that need to convert social interactions into booked appointments and long-term customer relationships, while providing the operational efficiency and business insights that messaging-only solutions cannot deliver.
